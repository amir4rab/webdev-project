in my opinion, the bast way to install Node Js and Npm on Linux and Mac Os system is with some sort of node package manager. in this tutorial we will use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can follow their tutorial on GitHub or continue with us.

1. check for updates:

    run the two following commands
   
    ```shell
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
    ```

2. run one of the following install script commands
    ```shell
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
    ```
    ```shell
    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
    ```

3. now run these to commands to finish the installation.
    ```shell
    export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
    [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
    ```

4. verify the installation
    ```shell
    command -v nvm
    ```

5. install node
    ```shell
    nvm install node
    ```

every thing should be ready by now, for more information please check nvms [GitHub](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
